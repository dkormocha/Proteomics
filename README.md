MSc Bioinformatics Project: Explaining incomplete tryptic digestion

The aim of the project was to explain incomplete tryptic digestion and create machine learning models to predict missed cleavage sites.
This repsoritory contains all the code used for data wrangling of mass spectrometry proteomics data plus, building Random Forest and Neural Network models.
