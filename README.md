Abstract
Trypsin is a highly specific proteolytic enzyme that exclusively hydrolyses peptide bonds at the carboxyl-terminus of Lysine and Arginine. This specificity makes trypsin the preferred proteolytic enzyme for protein digestion in bottom-up proteomics. This process requires trypsin to completely digest proteins in a complex sample into small peptides to identify and quantify proteins with high confidence. Unfortunately, during this process proteins are not completely digested, this is known as incomplete tryptic digestion and as a consequence missed cleaved peptides are produced. Predicting these missed cleavage sites can be a challenging problem, however, in this research machine learning models such as random forest and neural networks were used to predict missed cleavage sites. The existing missed cleavage predictor only uses the amino acid sequence and does not consider the 3D structure of the protein. This research mainly focuses on the 3D structure and its properties to predict missed cleavage. Features such as secondary structure and residue depth were incorporated into the machine learning models. The outcome of this project was a random forest model with a 0.84 accuracy and 0.84 precision in predicting missed cleavage; although, the neural network model performed poorly with a low accuracy possibly due to weak optimisation and small training dataset.
